🖱️ Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gestures
📌 Overview:
The Virtual Mouse is an innovative project that replaces physical mouse actions with hand gestures using a webcam. By detecting specific finger movements and positions, users can control cursor movements and perform actions like click, drag, and scroll without touching a mouse.

🧠 Technology Stack:
Python (Programming Language)

OpenCV (for image processing and camera input)

Mediapipe (for real-time hand tracking)

PyAutoGUI (to control the mouse using coordinates)

⚙️ How It Works:
Webcam Feed: Captures real-time video input.

Hand Detection: Mediapipe detects landmarks of the hand.

Cursor Movement: Index finger position controls the mouse pointer.

Clicking Mechanism: Distance between fingers (e.g., thumb & index) is used to detect a click gesture.

Scrolling & Dragging: Specific finger gestures are mapped to scroll or drag actions.

🎯 Key Features:
Touchless mouse control

Real-time hand tracking

No external hardware required except a webcam

Smooth and accurate cursor movement

🌟 Applications:
Assistive technology for differently-abled individuals

Touchless interaction in hygiene-sensitive environments

Gesture-based human-computer interaction

📁 Future Improvements:
Add multi-hand support

Increase gesture accuracy with AI models

Integrate with voice commands
